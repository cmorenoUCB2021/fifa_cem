<h2> Which FIFA Confederation has the strongest average performance?</h2>

<p>
  FIFA is an international governing body of association football, beach football and futsal. It was founded in 1904. FIFA divides the 
  countries in six regions (AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, UEFA). Each confederation implement an eliminatory process to define
  the countries representing them in the Wold Cup.  Wold Cups are implemented every 4 year, and there have been 21 world cups 
  within 1930 and 2018.  Economically, EUFA is the strongest confederation with the most money.  The following graphs explore
  the performance of the confederations in the World Cups.  The FIFA confederations are the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>AFC = Asian Football Confederation in Asia and Australia.</li>
  <li>CAF = Confédération Africaine de Football in Africa.</li>
  <li>CONCACAF = Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football in North America and Central America.</li>
  <li>CONMEBOL = Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol</li>
  <li>OFC = Oceania Football Confederation in Oceania</li>
  <li>UEFA = Union of European Football Associations</li>
</ol>

    Many players from Africa are now stars in European countries, and this has helped improve African
    countries performance in the world cup.  In the graph, it can be seen how countries belonging
    to CAF (Confédération Africaine de Football in Africa) have an improved performance since 1978.  
    However, this performance has been constant, and it has not increased in the last years.

    <p>
      Many players from Asia are also playing in European countries, and this has helped improve Asican
      countries performance in the world cup.  In the graph, it can be seen how countries belonging
      to AFC (sian Football Confederation in Asia and Australia) have an improved performance in 1994, 2002, 
      and 2010. The 2002 worl cup was held in South Korea and Japan, and this also helped in further
      developing futbol in this Asian region. However, their performance has decreased in the last two world cups.
